Dom Coverage
============
To assess the quality of web application test cases, web developers currently measure code coverage. Although code coverage has traditionally been a popular test adequacy criterion, we believe it alone is not an adequate metric for assessing the quality of web application test cases. We propose a set of novel DOM-based test adequacy criteria for web applications. These criteria aim at measuring coverage at two granularity levels (1) the percentage of DOM states and transitions covered in the total state space of the web application under test, and (2) the percentage of elements covered in each particular DOM state. We present a technique and tool, called DomCovery, which automatically extracts and measures the proposed adequacy criteria and generates a visual coverage report. Our evaluation shows that there is no correlation between code coverage and DOM-based coverage criteria. In addition, a controlled experiment with 10 participants illustrates the usefulness of DomCovery: participants using DomCovery completed test related tasks 22% more accurately and 66% faster.
